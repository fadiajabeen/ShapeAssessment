Shape Assessment is a one page (1 complete, 2nd Incomplete) ASP.NET MVC application demo on .Net Framework 6.
Which Saves the Sign up data into a MSSQL database using Entity Framework.
Error logging is kept minimal at this stage and the logs are saved in Windows Event logs or in Console
(for developement purpose).

There are 2 Layout files i.e., _Layout and _PreLoginLayout. As the name suggests all pages prior logging in 
will have a different layout than the after login pages.
Database schema has to be imported from the Database/shape_database.sql file. After which you can remove Database 
folder from the source code.Database connection string is kept in appsettings.json for now, which you can edit
depending upon your credentials.

The after Sign up page is only for the purpose of giving a thumbs up for the success of Registration process, which 
could have been a simple success message on the same page but anyways.
